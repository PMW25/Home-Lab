# Home-Lab

## Objective

Creating a personalized setup where you can build virtual environments, play with cutting-edge tools, and simulate real-world scenarios, all from the comfort of your home.

### Skills Learned

- Network configuration & management
- Log Management & analysis
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- Virtual Machine workstation as the hypervisor 
- Attack vector such as Kali Linux
- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.

## Steps

Virtualization route, setting up your environment:

1. Install a Hypervisor (VMware Workstation, VirtualBox, or Hyper-V).

2. Create Virtual Machines (VMs) for different components of your SOC. You can simulate various systems such as:

 Attacker Machine: Kali Linux or Parrot OS for penetration testing tools.
 Victim Machine: Windows and Linux OSes for simulating vulnerable systems.
 Security Tools and Servers: A SIEM (like Splunk)
